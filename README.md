# PrimeFinder
After compiling, when you run the program, you run it like "Primes 500 20". The first argument being the executable name, the second being how many prime numbers you want the program to find. Then it spits how a sideways histogram with the third arguments number of bars. This example would find 500 primes and make a histogram with 20 bars. This can find 1,000,000 primes in about 5 seconds, and 10,000,000 in just under 2 minutes.
